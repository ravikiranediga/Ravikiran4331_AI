# Data Analysis & Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my practice work in **Jupyter Notebooks**, where I explore and learn various concepts in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **data preprocessing**. It’s a collection of experiments, exercises, and projects I’ve worked on during my free time to strengthen my skills.

## 📘 What You'll Find
- Hands-on notebooks covering:
  - Data preprocessing techniques
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Machine learning model building
  - Visualization with popular Python libraries
- Examples and experiments using real-world datasets

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – basic plotting and visualization
- **Seaborn** – advanced statistical visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** *(optional, if you used it)* – machine learning models

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo is a personal learning space where I:
- Practice data analysis workflows
- Experiment with preprocessing methods
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Improve visualization skills

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the notebooks:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravikiranediga/Ravikiran4331_AI.git
